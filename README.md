====

![screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/movies/master/screens/2.png)

Complete TV interface for unlimited watching in streaming movies.
Use iTunes for finding movies informations and BitTorrent for downloading and streaming movies.

It runs a server which can run in a Raspberry Pi and the UI can be controlled from a smartphone (no need of keyboard or mouse).

This application is the result of a 24h personal hackathon (7th of July 2013) by Aaron O'Mullan (@AaronO) and me (@SamyPesse).
