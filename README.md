Complete TV interface for unlimited watching in streaming movies.
Use iTunes for finding movies informations and BitTorrent for downloading and streaming movies.

It runs a server which can run in a Raspberry Pi and the UI can be controlled by a smartphone (no need of keyboard or mouse).

This application is the result of a 24h personal hackathon (7 july 2013) by Aaron O'Mullan (@AaronO) and me (@SamyPesse).
